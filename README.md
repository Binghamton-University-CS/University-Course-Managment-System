This code defines a program that manages courses and student enrollment.

First, it defines two structures, Course and Student, that represent the properties of a course and a student, respectively. Then, it defines several helper functions that check the validity of input strings or integers: isValidBNumber checks if a string is a valid B Number, isValidUserID checks if a string is a valid user ID, isValidCRN checks if an integer is a valid course registration number, findStudentIndex finds the index of a student with a given B Number in an array of students, and findCourseIndex finds the index of a course with a given CRN in an array of courses.

The enroll function adds a new student to an array of students, if the input arguments are valid and the student does not already exist in the array. It first checks if any of the input arguments are empty, and if so, it prints an error message and returns. Then, it checks if a student with the same B Number already exists in the array, and if so, it prints an error message and returns. Finally, it creates a new student object, adds it to a new array of students (with size one greater than the original array), and deletes the original array.

The showPrompt function prints out a set of commands that the user can enter into the program, along with the expected input format for each command.

The main function initializes several variables and starts a loop that reads in user input from the console. Depending on the input command, it performs different operations on an array of courses and an array of students. The possible commands are:

build: adds a new course to the array of courses, with a given CRN, department, course number, and name. If any of the input arguments are invalid, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
cancel: removes a course from the array of courses with a given CRN.
enroll: adds a new student to the array of students, with a given B Number, user ID, first name, and last name. If any of the input arguments are invalid, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration of the loop.
add: enrolls a student in a course, given their B Number and the CRN of the course. If the student or course do not exist, or if the student is already enrolled in the course, it prints an error message.
drop: removes a student from a course, given their B Number and the CRN of the course. If the student or course do not exist, or if the student is not enrolled in the course, it prints an error message.
roster: prints out a list of all students enrolled in a course, given the CRN of the course.
schedule: prints out a list of all courses in which a student is enrolled, given their B Number.
quit: exits the program.
